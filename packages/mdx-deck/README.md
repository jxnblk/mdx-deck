## Getting Started

```sh
npm i -D mdx-deck
```

Create an [MDX][] file and separate each slide with `---`.

````mdx
# This is the title of my deck

---

# About Me

---

```jsx
<CodeSnippet />
```

---

import Demo from './components/Demo'

## <Demo />

# The end
````

Add a run script to your `package.json` with the MDX Deck CLI
pointing to the `.mdx` file to start the dev server:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "mdx-deck deck.mdx"
}
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

## Using MDX

MDX uses Markdown syntax and can render React components inline with JSX.

### Imports

To import components, use ES import syntax separated with empty lines between any markdown or JSX syntax.

```mdx
import { Box } from 'rebass'

<Box color="tomato">Hello</Box>
```

Read more about MDX syntax in the [MDX Docs][mdx].

## Theming

<div>
  <img src='docs/images/future.png' width='256' />
  <img src='docs/images/comic.png' width='256' />
  <img src='docs/images/yellow.png' width='256' />
</div>

MDX Deck uses [Theme UI][] and [Emotion][] for styling, making practically any part of the presentation themeable.
It also includes several built-in themes to change the look and feel of the presentation.
See the list of available [Themes](docs/themes.md),
or read more about theming in the [Theming](docs/theming.md) docs.

## Components

MDX Deck includes built-in components to help with creating presentations, including a background `Image` component, an `Appear` component that allows stepping through parts of a single slide, and a `Notes` component for adding speaker notes.
Read more in the [Components](docs/components.md) docs.

## Third-Party Components

These optional libraries are intended for use with MDX Deck.

- [CodeSurfer][]: React component for scrolling, zooming and highlighting code.
- [mdx-code][]: Runnable code playgrounds for MDX Deck.
- [mdx-deck-live-code][]: Live React and JS coding in slides.

_Note: please check with version compatibility when using these libraries._

## Layouts

Each slide can include a custom layout around its content,
which can be used as a *template* for visually differentiating slides.

```js
// example Layout.js
import React from 'react'

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div
    style={{
      width: '100vw',
      height: '100vw',
      backgroundColor: 'tomato',
    }}>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

```mdx
import Layout from './Layout'

# No Layout

---

<Layout>

# Custom Layout

</Layout>
```

The layout component will wrap the MDX elements within that slide,
which means you can add layout styles, use a nested ThemeProvider, or style elements with CSS-in-JS.

## Built-in Layouts

MDX Deck includes a few [built-in layouts](docs/layouts.md) for inverting theme colors and changing the layout of a slide.

## Presenter Mode

Use [_Presenter Mode_](docs/presenting.md) when on stage to show a preview of the next slide, a timer, and speaker notes.
