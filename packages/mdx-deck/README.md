## Getting Started

Create an [MDX][] file and separate each slide with `---`.

````mdx
# This is the title of my deck

---

# About Me

---

```jsx
<CodeSnippet />
```

---

import Demo from './components/Demo'

## <Demo />

# The end
````

Add a run script to your `package.json` with the MDX Deck CLI
pointing to the `.mdx` file to start the dev server:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "mdx-deck deck.mdx"
}
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

## Using MDX

MDX can use Markdown syntax and render React components with JSX.

### Imports

To import components, use ES import syntax separated with empty lines between any markdown or JSX syntax.

```mdx
import { Box } from 'grid-styled'

<Box color="tomato">Hello</Box>
```

Read more about MDX syntax in the [MDX Docs][mdx].

## Theming

MDX Deck uses [emotion][] for styling, making practically any part of the presentation themeable.

### Built-in Themes

<div>
  <img src='docs/images/future.png' width='256' />
  <img src='docs/images/comic.png' width='256' />
  <img src='docs/images/yellow.png' width='256' />
</div>

MDX Deck includes several built-in themes to change the look and feel of the presentation.
Export `theme` from your MDX file to enable a theme.

```mdx
export { dark as theme } from 'mdx-deck/themes'

# Dark Theme
```

MDX uses [exports](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx#exports) as a way for files to communicate with their parent components.
For a list of available themes see the [Themes Docs](docs/themes.md).

### Custom Themes

A custom theme can be provided by exporting `theme` from the MDX file.

```mdx
export { default as theme } from './theme'

# Hello
```

The theme should be an object with fields for fonts, colors, and CSS for individual components.

```js
// example theme.js
export default {
  // add a custom font
  font: 'Roboto, sans-serif',
  // custom colors
  colors: {
    text: '#f0f',
    background: 'black',
    link: '#0ff',
  },
}
```

Read more about theming in the [Theming docs](docs/theming.md)

### Components

MDX Deck includes built-in components to help with creating presentations, including a full screen Image component, the Appear component that allows stepping through parts of a single slide, and the Notes component for adding speaker notes.

Read more in the [components docs](docs/components.md).

### Libraries

These third-party libraries are great for use with MDX Deck.

- [CodeSurfer][]: React component for scrolling, zooming and highlighting code.
- [mdx-code][]: Runnable code playgrounds for MDX Deck.
- [mdx-deck-live-code][]: Live React and JS coding in slides.

_Note: please check with version compatibility when using these libraries._

[codesurfer]: https://github.com/pomber/code-surfer
[mdx-code]: https://github.com/pranaygp/mdx-code
[mdx-deck-live-code]: https://github.com/JReinhold/mdx-deck-live-code

### Layouts

Each slide can include a custom layout around its content.
This can be used as a substitute for slide templates found in other presentation apps and libraries.

```js
// example Layout.js
import React from 'react'

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div
    style={{
      width: '100vw',
      height: '100vw',
      backgroundColor: 'tomato',
    }}>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

```mdx
import Layout from './Layout'

# No Layout

---

<Layout>

# Custom Layout

</Layout>
```

The layout component will wrap the MDX elements within that slide,
which means you can use a nested ThemeProvider or target elements with CSS-in-JS.

### Built-in Layouts

MDX Deck includes some built-in layouts for inverting theme colors and changing the layout of a slide.
Read more about [built-in layouts](docs/components.md#layouts).

## Presenter Mode

MDX Deck includes a built-in _Presenter Mode_, with a preview of the next slide and a timer.

![presenter mode screenshot](docs/images/presenter-mode.png)

To use presenter mode:

1. Open your presentation and press `Option + P` to enter _Presenter Mode_
2. Click on the link in the bottom to open the presentation in another tab
3. Move the other window to the screen for the audience to see
4. Control the presentation from your window using the left and right arrow keys â€“ the other window should stay in sync
5. Be sure to move your cursor so that it doesn't drive anyone in the audience crazy

### Speaker Notes

Notes that only show in presenter mode can be added to any slide.
Speaker notes can be added using the `<Notes />` component.

```mdx
import { Notes } from 'mdx-deck'

# Slide Content

<Notes>Only visible in presenter mode</Notes>
```

## Overview Mode

![Overview Mode](docs/images/overview-mode.png)

When editing a slide deck, toggle overview mode with `Option + O`.
This shows a list of all slides on the left and a preview of the current slide on the right.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key         | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Left Arrow  | Go to previous slide (or step in [Appear][]) |
| Right Arrow | Go to next slide (or step in [Appear][])     |
| Space       | Go to next slide (or step in [Appear][])     |
| Option + P  | Toggle [Presenter Mode](#presenter-mode)     |
| Option + O  | Toggle [Overview Mode](#overview-mode)       |

}
```

See more exporting options in the [Exporting Documentation](docs/exporting.md)
