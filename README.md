## Getting Started

Create an [MDX][] file and separate each slide with `---`.

````mdx
# This is the title of my deck
---
# About Me
---
```jsx
<CodeSnippet />
```
---
import Demo from './components/Demo'

<Demo />
---
# The end
````

Add a run script to your `package.json` with the mdx-deck CLI
pointing to the `.mdx` file to start the dev server:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "mdx-deck deck.mdx"
}
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm start
```

## Quick Start

To create a new presentation with zero-configuration, run the following command to generate a presentation deck in a new folder:

```sh
npm init deck my-presentation-name
```

## Using MDX

MDX can use Markdown syntax and render React components with JSX.

### Imports

To import components, use ES import syntax separated with empty lines from any markdown or JSX syntax.

```mdx
import { Box } from 'grid-styled'

<Box color='tomato'>
  Hello
</Box>
```

Read more about MDX syntax in the [MDX Docs][MDX].

## Theming

mdx-deck uses [styled-components][] for styling, making practically any part of the presentation themeable.

### Built-in Themes

<div>
  <img src='docs/images/future.png' width='256' />
  <img src='docs/images/comic.png' width='256' />
  <img src='docs/images/yellow.png' width='256' />
</div>

mdx-deck includes several built-in themes to change the look and feel of the presentation.
Export `theme` from your MDX file to enable a theme.

```mdx
export { dark as theme } from 'mdx-deck/themes'

# Dark Theme
```

MDX uses [exports](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx#exports) as a way for files to communicate with their parent components.
For a list of available themes see the [Themes Docs](docs/themes.md).

### Custom Themes

A custom theme can be provided by exporting `theme` from the MDX file.

```mdx
export { default as theme } from './theme'

# Hello
```

The theme should be an object with fields for fonts, colors, and CSS for individual components.
It's recommended that all custom themes extend the default theme as a base.

```js
// example theme.js
import theme from 'mdx-deck/themes'

export default {
  // extends the default theme
  ...theme,
  // add a custom font
  font: 'Roboto, sans-serif',
  // custom colors
  colors: {
    text: '#f0f',
    background: 'black',
    link: '#0ff',
  }
}
```

Read more about theming in the [Theming docs](docs/theming.md)

### Components

mdx-deck includes built-in components to help with creating presentations, including a full screen Image component, the Appear component that allows stepping through parts of a single slide, and the Notes component for adding speaker notes.

Read more in the [components docs](docs/components.md).

### Libraries

These third-party libraries are great for use with mdx-deck.

- [CodeSurfer][]: React component for scrolling, zooming and highlighting code.
- [mdx-code][]: Runnable code playgrounds for MDX Deck.

[codesurfer]: https://github.com/pomber/code-surfer
[mdx-code]: https://github.com/pranaygp/mdx-code

### Layouts

Each slide can include a custom layout around its content.
This can be used as a substitute for slide templates found in other presentation apps and libraries.

```js
// example Layout.js
import React from 'react'

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div
    style={{
      width: '100vw',
      height: '100vw',
      backgroundColor: 'tomato'
    }}>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

```mdx
import Layout from './Layout'

# No Layout

---
export default Layout

# Custom Layout
```

The layout component will wrap the MDX elements within that slide,
which means you can use a nested ThemeProvider or target elements with CSS-in-JS.

### Built-in Layouts

mdx-deck includes some built-in layouts for inverting theme colors and changing the layout of a slide. Read more about [built-in layouts](docs/components.md#layouts).

## Presenter Mode

mdx-deck includes a built-in presenter mode, with a preview of the next slide and a timer.

![presenter mode screenshot](docs/images/presenter-mode.png)

To use presenter mode:

- Open two windows in the same browser, with the same URL on two different screens. (this should work in both development and exported presentations)
- In your window, press the `Option/Alt + P` keys to enter presenter mode.
- Display the other window on the screen for the audience to see.
- Control the presentation from your window by using the left and right arrow keys; the other window should stay in sync

### Speaker Notes

Notes that only show in presenter mode can be added to any slide.
Speaker notes can be added in one of the following two ways:

**Markdown:** Use the `notes` language attribute in a fenced code block to add speaker notes.

````mdx
# Slide Content

```notes
These are only visible in presenter mode
```
````

**Notes Component:** Use the `Notes` component to create more complex speaker notes.

```mdx
import { Notes } from 'mdx-deck'

# Slide Content

<Notes>
  Only visible in presenter mode
</Notes>
```

## Overview Mode

![Overview Mode](docs/images/overview-mode.png)

When editing a slide deck, toggle overview mode with `Option + O`.
This shows a list of all slides on the left and a preview of the current slide on the right.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Key         | Description
----------- | -----------
Left Arrow  | Go to previous slide (or step in [Appear][])
Right Arrow | Go to next slide (or step in [Appear][])
Space       | Go to next slide (or step in [Appear][])
Up Arrow    | Hide current step in [Appear][] component without navigating slides
Down Arrow  | Show next step in [Appear][] component without navigating slides
Option + P  | Toggle [Presenter Mode](#presenter-mode)
Option + O  | Toggle [Overview Mode](#overview-mode)
Option + G  | Toggle grid view mode

[Appear]: docs/components.md#appear

## Exporting

Add a `build` script to your `package.json` to export a presentation as HTML with a JS bundle.

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "mdx-deck build deck.mdx"
}
```

See more exporting options in the [Exporting Documentation](docs/exporting.md)

## CLI Options

```
-p --port     Dev server port
-h --host     Host the dev server listens to
--no-open     Prevent from opening in default browser
-d --out-dir  Output directory for exporting
